            with a seemingly inharmonious love for order and logic. Growing up
            and discovering myself inside of that dichotomy was (and is)
            confusing. In school, math was interesting, accessible and
            gratifying. But art was alluring and challenging and oh so soul
            nourishing. Neither felt fully like me. So, I went off to college
            without a clue and without pursuing either. Then, in my first year,
            fate sent me a friend in the Department of Design and I discovered
            my passion at the intersection of form and function.

            <span className="paragraph-start">Almost a decade later,</span> I am
            still exploring that intersection in my work. I’ve worked across
            countless industries helping small business owners, department
            heads, startups and artists create beautiful solutions to their
            practical needs. From designing intuitive user interfaces, to
            strategizing seamless customer experiences, to building robust
            websites and applications, each of my projects delivers a compelling
            on-brand experience layered over powerful backend performance.

            orange tabbies and several cacti.
